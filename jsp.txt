jsp
----------------------------
* jsp technology is used to create web applications like servlet.
* we can take jsp as a extension version of sevrelt because it provieds more functionality then servlet 
* jsp pages conatai both HTML tags and JSP tags.
* jsp pages are easy to maintain then servlet,because here we can seprate designing and development>
advantage of jsp
--------------------------------
* extension to servlet-we can use both servlet features and inplicit objects,predefined tags,expression language and custome tags,which makes jsp development easy.
* easy to maintain  
* fast development- no need to recompile and redeploy
* less code than servelt

life cycle of jsp
--------------------------------
*translation
*instatiation - creating obj 
*initialization
*service
*destroy
THE MAIN METHODS OF JSP LIFE CYCLE ARE
                 *JSPInit()
                 *_JSPService()
                 *JSPDestroy()


jsp API-here we have totally two packages ->javax.servlet.jsp
                                          ->javax.servlet.jsp.tagext
--------------
1.javax.servlet.jsp
here we have two interfaces and classes they are 

interfaces                             classes
----------------                     --------------------

                                        jspengineinfo

    *public void jspdestroy()

    *public void _jspservice()


jsp scriptlet tag
-------------------------------
is mainly used to execute java source code in jsp 
syntax:  <% java scource code %>
           ex: <html>
               <body>
               <% "welcome to jsp" %>
               </body>
               </html>


jsp expression tag
--------------------------
* the code in jsp expression tag is used to print outputstream of response.
* no need of writtin out.print() to write data.
* it is mainly used print values of variable or method>
syntax: <%= statement%>
        ex: <html>
            <body>
            <%= "welcome to jsp" %>
            </body>
            </html>

Note: Do not end your statement with semicolon in case of expression tag.

jsp declaration tag
-------------------------------
* it is mainly used to declare fields and methods.
* the code written in side jsp declaration tag is placed outside service method of auto generated servlet.
* so it doesn't  get memory at each request
Syntax:  <%! field or method declaration %>

jsp implicit objects 
--------------------------------
out
request
response
config
session
page
pagecontext
application
exception


jsp directives
syntax: <%@directive attribute ="value"%>
---------------------------------------------
jsp directives are messages that tells the web container how to translate a jsp page into the corresponding servlet.these are three types they are
1.jsp page directive
     it defines attributes that apply to an entire jsp page
     Syntax: <%@page attribute="value"%>
attributes of page directive
  ->import-The import attribute is used to import class,interface or all the members of a package.It is similar to import keyword in java class or interface.
  ->content type
  ->extends
  ->info-This attribute simply sets the information of the JSP page which is retrieved later by using getServletInfo() method of Servlet interface.
  ->buffer-The buffer attribute sets the buffer size in kilobytes to handle output generated by the JSP page.The default size of the buffer is 8Kb.
  ->langauge-The language attribute specifies the scripting language used in the JSP page. The default value is "java".
  ->isELIgnored
  ->isThreadsafe
  ->autoflash
  ->session
  ->pageEncoding
  ->errorpage
  ->isErrorpage
2.jsp include directive
    this is used to include the contents of any resource.it may be jsp file,html file or text file
    include directive includes original content of the included resource at page translation.
    the advantage of this is code reusability
 Syntax: <%@include file ="resourceName"%>

Note: The include directive includes the original content, so the actual page size grows at runtime.

3.jsp taglib directive
       this directive is ude to define a tag library that defines many tags.
       we use tld(tag library descriptor)filr to define tgs
 Syntax:<% @ taglib uri="uriofthetaglibrary" prefix="prefixoftaglibrary"%>



jsp  action tags
--------------------------------------------
there are many jsp action tags or elements 
each tag is used to perfoem some specific tasks

they are 
1.jsp:forward-The jsp:forward action tag is used to forward the request to another resource it may be jsp, html or another resource.
         Syntax of jsp:forward action tag without parameter
                       <jsp:forward page="relativeURL | <%= expression %>" />  
         Syntax of jsp:forward action tag with parameter
                       <jsp:forward page="relativeURL | <%= expression %>">  
                       <jsp:param name="parametername" value="parametervalue | <%=expression%>" />  
                       </jsp:forward>  


2.jsp:include
3.jsb:usebean
4.jsb:setproperty
5.jsb:getproperty
6.jsp:plugin
7.jsp:param
8.jsp:fallback
